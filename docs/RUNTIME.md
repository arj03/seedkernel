## 10. Performance

The message path does **no asymmetric cryptography and no recursion**: routing a frame to a handler is a name lookup (§3) plus two scratch copies and the transform's own work (§4). The per-message signature verify that used to dominate is gone — authenticity is the channel's (§12.6), established once when the link opens, not checked per message.

### 10.1 Where the crypto is now

So the costs worth measuring are the three places real cryptography lives, all off the dispatch hot path:

- **Per connection:** the AKE handshake (§12.6) — one Ed25519 sign + verify and one X25519 exchange, amortised across the whole session.
- **Per frame:** one ChaCha20-Poly1305 record seal/open (§12.6) — symmetric, fast, the steady-state transport cost.
- **Per bundle load:** one Ed25519 manifest verify plus a BLAKE2b-256 content hash per module (§12.4) — once, at install.

The Go/native target carries `*_bench_test.go` benchmarks over these hot paths (net round-trip, fs, the crypto primitives, the record layer); `WASM/tests/run.mjs` exercises the same paths end-to-end on the JS target, and seed store's `WASM/tests/bench.mjs` measures storage throughput. There is no signed-message microbenchmark anymore because there is no signed message — a chat frame crosses the WASM boundary only for its handler's single pure-transform call.

### 10.2 Distribution Size

| Component | Size |
|---|---|
| host/*.js — minified (`build/host-min`; ~29 KB gzipped) | ~117 KB |
| libsodium.wasm (sumo build: Ed25519 + BLAKE2b + XChaCha20, the §12.1 backends) | 278 KB |
| libsodium-wrappers.mjs + libsodium-core.mjs | 152 KB |
| **Total browser deployment** | **~547 KB** |
| QuickJS realm engine (the single release-sync build, from `quickjs-emscripten`) — only loaded when a bundle's guest runs (§12.3) | ~750 KB |

The kernel costs nothing to ship: it is a map inside the host (§3), not a module. The `host/*.js` layer is the whole runtime — it holds the table, reaches handlers by name (`callHandler`), admits bundles under policy (§12.4–§12.5), and carries the whole shell (§12) — net, fs, the cap-bridge, safe-js, bundle verification, policy, and the entire node↔node transport stack (§12.6), which now lives in shared JS rather than a per-target reimplementation. That transport is the bulk of why the host is larger than a table-only driver would be. libsodium is the host's crypto library (BLAKE2b for content hashing and the §12.1 hash backend, Ed25519 for manifests and the handshake, ChaCha20 / XChaCha20 for the record layer and the §12.1 backends); the sumo build is larger than a sign-only build because it backs all of them. Content hashing is BLAKE2b (`crypto_generichash`), the one hash the whole system uses (§5.1). The QuickJS engine is lazy: a node that only relays and dispatches never pays for it.

`npm run build` emits the host twice: the readable `build/host` (~203 KB, doc comments intact) for debugging and a comment-stripped `build/host-min` (~117 KB, ~29 KB gzipped) for shipping. A small dependency-free stripper (`scripts/minify.mjs`, each output gated through `node --check`) does the cut — no bundler, no new dependencies. The table's host figure is the shipped, minified build.

## 11. Example app layer: chat (`chat-shell.html`)

Chat is the simplest possible app: a single **pure-transform** handler (§4) bound at an app name. The handler does no I/O and no crypto — the shell hands it `senderPk ‖ chatType ‖ body` and it returns the render bytes for the UI. Everything around it — authenticating the sender, moving frames, driving the iframe — is the shell's job, because a pure transform has no reach of its own.

`WASM/browser/chat-shell.html` is a runnable end-to-end demo of the whole stack: a browser shell that owns only the kernel, the bundle loader and its admission policy, a WebRTC transport (`RtcNetwork`, `host/net-rtc.ts`, §12.7), and a sandboxed iframe — every byte of chat UI and logic arrives as a signed bundle admitted at runtime.

On load it generates an Ed25519 identity, constructs a host (§3), and loads an admission policy (§12.5) approving modules whose author is the local identity — or, for apps received from a peer, one the user consents to. That consent decision is the browser's own policy state, and it is the only one the shell has to make: names cannot contend (§5.1), so a multi-app shell arbitrates *whether code runs*, never *who holds a name*. The table starts empty. The user picks a chat app from a dropdown (`v1 — text only`, `v2 — text + image + nick`); the shell builds a **signed bundle** — a `manifest.bundle` (the local key's Ed25519 signature over the manifest, which commits to the module's `genesisHash`) plus the app's `.wasm`, packed into one blob (§12.4) — verifies it, and the loader admits the module under that policy (§12.4). This is the *same* bundle format seed store loads; a chat app is just a one-module, guest-less bundle. Upgrading v1→v2 is a re-admit at the same name under the same key — the same key derives the same name — and it keeps the `chat` binding it already held (§12.10). Peers hand these bundles to each other in an `OFFER` frame; the recipient re-verifies the original author's manifest signature and admits it the same way — and because the manifest signs the module hash, the bundle survives any number of transitive relays and still authenticates against its original author (the store-and-forward property an offer needs, §12.4).

Peers connect over a WebRTC mesh from `RtcNetwork` (`host/net-rtc.ts`, §12.7) — the same relay-signaled, perfect-negotiation fabric the storage demo uses, here consumed directly for fire-and-forget `send`. The signaling relay (`scripts/relay.mjs`), set on the **Network** tab, is only the rendezvous for the SDP/ICE exchange and can be killed once channels are open. Every frame `RtcNetwork` delivers is already attributed to an authenticated peer (§12.6), so chat messages now ride the Transport request plane like everything else — `[req][protocolId][type][chatType‖body]`, one plane, one dispatch scheme — and the shell treats the channel's `_from` as the message author: on receipt it resolves the protocol id through its bindings to an app key (§12.10), prepends that authenticated pubkey to the handler's input, runs the pure transform with `host.callHandler` at the app's derived name, and posts the returned render bytes to the iframe. A peer's frame therefore says only *what protocol this is*; which of the chat apps the receiving user holds renders it is that user's own binding, so two peers running different authors' chat apps interoperate as long as both speak the protocol. Because a chat frame travels a **single hop** over the authenticated link, the channel's hop-by-hop attribution *is* end-to-end here — there is no envelope signer to verify and nothing relayed (contrast a feed or forum, §5.1, which would sign each message and chain it). A `Start call` button also publishes audio/video over the same `RTCPeerConnection`s as per-peer tiles above the chat UI; a network change kicks an ICE restart (`RtcNetwork.restartAllIce`) so a transient drop recovers without reconnecting.

The relay is partitioned into **rooms** so one instance hosts many independent groups without cross-talk. A client picks its room as the URL path — `ws://host:8080/<room>` — and the relay forwards only between sockets sharing a room; a bare `/` lands in the default room `global`. The shell exposes this as a Room field on the **Network** tab, with a **Random** button that fills in 64 bits of hex entropy (a private rendezvous token). Room names are URL-safe (`[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, ≤128 chars). The room is **not** an authenticated channel — knowing the name is the only credential, and the relay sees all signaling in its room — but the end-to-end identity binding below means a relay or room member cannot impersonate a peer, only observe SDP metadata and refuse to forward.

`RtcNetwork` binds channel identity with `PeerLink`'s in-channel HELLO/AUTH challenge (`host/net-link.ts`, §12.6): each end proves it holds the private key for the pubkey it claims *before* any frame is delivered, then every later frame rides the §12.6 ChaCha20-Poly1305 record layer, attributed to that identity rather than to anything inside the frame. This is continuous channel binding, stronger than a one-shot SDP `a=fingerprint` assertion at the signaling layer (RFC 8827 §5.6.4) — a MITM relay can splice SDP and bring DTLS up to itself, but can never complete AUTH without the peer's private key, so the link never authenticates and never delivers a byte. The record layer already makes every frame confidential and integrity-protected; the data channel's own DTLS is a redundant second layer underneath (§12.7).

The chat handler never reaches the UI itself: it is a pure transform that *returns* render bytes, which the shell forwards to the iframe by `postMessage`. The iframe is `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms"` with no same-origin access to the shell, so app-rendered content stays walled off from the shell's keys and peer state.

To run it locally: build the WASM artifacts (the chat app modules) into `WASM/build/`, then serve `WASM/browser/` over HTTPS (the bundled `localhost+1.pem` / `localhost+1-key.pem` are mkcert certs for `localhost`) and open `chat-shell.html` in two browsers to chat between them.

## 12. The runtime as an app host: capabilities, the shell, and signed bundles

Chat (§11) is a browser shell wired by hand. The same onion ships as a **general runtime artifact** — the *shell* — that any app rides on as **signed content**. The shell knows nothing about chat or storage; it offers a fixed, generic surface, verifies a bundle against a policy, and *becomes* whatever the bundle is. [seed store](https://github.com/arj03/seedstore) is the worked example: a full peer-to-peer storage node is the shell plus a signed bundle, with no storage-specific code in the runtime.

"Capabilities" from here on mean one thing: the **bundle cap domains** (§12.2, §12.4) — five coarse names (`crypto`, `net`, `fs`, `module`, `clock`) that a bundle's signed manifest grants to the app's confined JS *guest*. They answer "may this *app's guest* reach this backend at all?" (WASM handlers, by contrast, carry no capabilities at all — a pure transform reaches nothing but the input it is handed and the output it returns, §4.2.)

The manifest's `guest.caps` field is the guest's *entire* authority — which is why it lives inside the signed manifest, nested under `guest`, and nowhere else. It has to: the guest is not a kernel handler — it has no name in the kernel's table at all, so nothing below the signed manifest could carry its authority.

### 12.1 Raw-byte capability backends

The runtime provides the capability *backends* an app's confined logic drives through the cap-bridge (§12.2). They are deliberately structureless — bytes in, bytes out — so the kernel never learns what an app means by them:

- `crypto.*` — the bundled sumo libsodium: hash (BLAKE2b), `sign`/`verify` (Ed25519), the raw `stream_xor` (xchacha20), `random` (`host/cap-bridge.ts`, backed by `loadSodium`). `sign` is under the node identity but **scoped**: the host prepends `DOMAIN_guest` plus the app's identity to the message before signing (§12.2), so a guest never obtains a raw node-key signature. Raw signing stays host-internal (it backs the PeerLink handshake, §12.6).
- `net.*` — an authenticated request/response transport over a `Network` (`host/net.ts`): node↔node over raw TCP, browser↔node over RFC 6455 WebSocket (`host/net-node.ts`), or peer↔peer over WebRTC (`host/net-rtc.ts`, §12.7), each connection pinned to a peer's kernel pubkey by a challenge/response (`host/net-link.ts`). It offers `send` (a single peer request/response) and `peers`; a guest fans out itself with `Promise.all` over `send` (§12.2, §12.3).
- `fs.*` — raw bytes under an opaque, flat key (`host/fs.ts`): `get`/`put`/`size`/`list`/`delete`/`stat` (existence is `size ≥ 0`, so there is no separate `has`). An in-RAM `MemoryFs` and a directory-backed `NodeFs` (`host/fs-node.ts`); OPFS/IndexedDB in the browser later. No content-addressing, no paths — that's app policy.
- `clock` and an installed-handler call (`KernelHost.callHandler`) to reach a WASM handler by name.

Anything with *structure* is a **no-capability module** that transforms bytes: WebSocket framing is `ws.wasm` (`./ws`), Reed–Solomon erasure coding is an app's `codec.wasm` — both pure transforms the host drives, never something the kernel knows.

### 12.2 The cap-bridge: the guest op ABI

An app's confined logic reaches all of the above through a single seam, `host.call(op, bytes) → bytes` — the guest's one route to real I/O, the counterpart to the host's own `callHandler`. `host/cap-bridge.ts` (`./cap-bridge`) services that seam from the primitives above and *only* those. Every op is application-neutral; the bridge has no idea it is hosting storage.

The op numbers are a **shared guest↔host identifier**, not a wire value: the generated preamble injects them into the guest as `const CAP_<NAME> = n;` and the bridge switch reads the same table, so the two cannot drift (regenerated together, never independently versioned, never sent between nodes). The set is one contiguous block grouped by domain; new ops are appended. Multi-byte integers are big-endian (§16).

| # | Op | Request | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `HASH` | message bytes | 32-byte generic hash (BLAKE2b) |
| 2 | `STREAM_XOR` | `[nonce 24][key 32][msg ..]` | `msg` ⊕ XChaCha20 keystream |
| 3 | `SIGN` | message bytes | 64-byte detached Ed25519 signature under the node identity, over `DOMAIN_guest ‖ scope ‖ msg` — the scope is host-derived (below, §16.1), never guest-supplied |
| 4 | `VERIFY` | `[pk 32][sig 64][msg ..]` | `[valid u8]` |
| 5 | `IDENTITY` | (empty) | the node's 32-byte public key |
| 6 | `RANDOM` | `[n u32]` | `n` random bytes |
| 7 | `NET_SEND` | `[peer 32][pidLen u8][protocolId utf8][type u8][payload ..]` | `[ok u8][response ..]` |
| 8 | `NET_PEERS` | (empty) | `[count u32][pk 32 ×count]` |
| 9 | `FS_GET` | key (utf8) | `[0]` absent \| `[1][bytes ..]` |
| 10 | `FS_PUT` | `[klen u32][key][bytes ..]` | (empty) |
| 11 | `FS_LIST` | prefix (utf8, may be empty) | `[count u32] {[klen u32][key]}` |
| 12 | `FS_DELETE` | key (utf8) | (empty) |
| 13 | `FS_STAT` | (empty) | `[used u64][available u64]` |
| 14 | `FS_SIZE` | key (utf8) | `[size i32]` (−1 if absent) |
| 15 | `MODULE_CALL` | `[name_len u8][name utf8][request ..]` | the installed handler's response bytes — `name` is the logical name from the manifest; the bridge resolves it to the kernel name (§12.4) |
| 16 | `CLOCK` | (empty) | now in unix ms (`u64`) |

`NET_SEND` is the only op that genuinely round-trips: the guest `await`s it, and a fan-out is the guest's own `Promise.all` over it — the seam hands out real promises, so scatter-gather is the guest's own, not a host op. Every other op resolves to bytes without yielding.

**The signing op is scoped, never raw.** `SIGN` does not sign the guest's bytes as given: the host signs `DOMAIN_guest ‖ scope ‖ msg`, where `scope = author_pk ‖ app_len u8 ‖ app` is derived from the admitted manifest (§12.4) — the same `(author, app)` pair that keys freshness — never guest-supplied. The domain-prefix family is disjoint (§14, §16.1), so a guest-obtained signature never verifies as a manifest or a channel AUTH; and distinct bundles derive disjoint scopes, so one app cannot sign in another's namespace. `VERIFY` stays raw — verification is not an oracle — so an app checks a scoped signature by reconstructing the preimage itself; every node running the same bundle derives the same scope, which makes the signatures portable across a cohort. One consequence: rotating a bundle's author key changes the scope and orphans previously signed objects, so an app anticipating handover records its scope inside its own signed formats. §14 has the trust rationale.

The **capability domains** a manifest declares (§12.4) expand to fixed op sets — the coarse, human-auditable vocabulary ("this app reaches net + fs"), not a list of op numbers:

| Domain | Ops |
| --- | --- |
| `crypto` | 1–6 (`HASH`, `STREAM_XOR`, `SIGN`, `VERIFY`, `IDENTITY`, `RANDOM`) |
| `net` | 7–8 (`NET_SEND`, `NET_PEERS`) |
| `fs` | 9–14 (`FS_GET`, `FS_PUT`, `FS_LIST`, `FS_DELETE`, `FS_STAT`, `FS_SIZE`) |
| `module` | 15 (`MODULE_CALL`) |
| `clock` | 16 (`CLOCK`) |

An op outside the granted domains does not resolve — the bridge refuses it, and the shell never wired the backing resource in the first place (an `fs`-less bundle gets no fs backend at all, not an fs backend behind a check). An unknown domain name in a manifest throws when the realm is built — a typo fails loudly rather than silently granting nothing, or, worse, everything.

**Relation to WASI.** The cap-bridge is deliberately WASI-shaped at the seam: a small syscall table, a zero-authority guest, capability by non-wiring rather than runtime check. The differences justify a bespoke ABI. The ops are identity-centric, not POSIX — `net` is addressed by peer pubkey over a channel bound to that key (§12.6), not by socket; `fs` is a flat opaque blob store with no paths; `SIGN`/`IDENTITY` surface the node's identity, which WASI has no notion of (and every guest signature is domain-scoped). And the grant is *signed content*: the guest's authority is the `guest.caps` field of an author-signed manifest (§12.4) admitted by operator policy (§12.5), where WASI's grants are host-local instantiation choices with no authorship. WASI begins after who authored the code and who may install it are settled; §12.4–§12.5 settle them. What keeps this from drifting into a worse WASI: ops stay structureless bytes, anything with structure becomes a no-capability module (§12.1), and the table grows by appending sparingly.

### 12.3 Zero-authority JS realms

Logic that is inherently async or awkward as a *synchronous* WASM handler runs as confined JS in a QuickJS-compiled-to-WASM realm (`host/safe-js.ts`, `./safe-js`). A fresh realm has only the ECMAScript intrinsics — it cannot even *name* `fs`/`net`/`process`/`fetch` — and reaches out only through the injected `host.call` seam. The seam is narrow-async: a sync op (crypto/fs/clock/module) resolves to bytes immediately, and the one round-tripping op (`NET_SEND`) returns a real Promise the guest `await`s. So the guest is ordinary async/await JS, a fan-out is `Promise.all`, and there is **one** realm — a single non-Asyncify build — serving both roles: `call()` runs an initiator that may `await` net, and `callSync()` answers an incoming request straight through *while* an initiator is parked mid-`await` in that same realm. A suspended async function is just heap state, so re-entering to run a synchronous handler is ordinary JS — no second engine, no Asyncify, no module-global suspend state. This is the chat shell's sandboxed-iframe confinement (§11) generalised: "run zero-authority guest JS over a cap seam," the sibling of "run a WASM handler under caps."

### 12.4 Signed bundles

An app is delivered as a **bundle** (`host/bundle.ts`, `./bundle`) — one blob of signed content, holding:

```
manifest.bundle     the signed manifest envelope (below)
<name>.wasm         each WASM handler module, named by its manifest `name`
guest.js            the zero-authority guest program (§12.3) — optional
```

A bundle is a **value, not a path**: one blob is read from disk, carried in an `OFFER` over a data channel, and stashed in browser storage without a second format or a second load path. The container framing is `"SKB1" │ count u16 │ count× (nameLen u16 │ name │ dataLen u32 │ data)`, all big-endian — pure naming, with no security properties of its own: the manifest envelope inside carries the author's signature and its module hashes protect the bytes, so anyone may repack a bundle without weakening it.

**Nothing in the manifest names a file.** A module lives in `<name>.wasm` and the guest in `guest.js`, by construction. A signed filename would be one more field every target must validate (and, where a target resolves it against a directory, one more chance to escape it); deriving it removes the field and the obligation together.

**What a bundle carries beyond the modules.** The loader binds exactly one kind of thing: WASM handlers into the kernel's table. A bundle wraps everything else an app is made of:

- **The guest is not a kernel handler.** It is JS source for a QuickJS realm, not WASM — the loader's path ends in "instantiate WASM, `SetHandler`." Without the manifest it would have no signed identity at all.
- **The guest's authority has no other home.** A WASM handler is a pure transform with no capabilities of its own (§4.2); the guest, by contrast, *does* reach I/O — through the cap-bridge — yet has no kernel name of its own, so the manifest's `guest.caps` is its entire capability declaration.
- **Version coherence.** Module binds are per-name and independent; nothing at the bind level says "codec at hash X, reputation at hash Y, and guest at hash Z together constitute app v1.2." The manifest is the author's signed statement of the coherent set — without it a node can hold a mix of individually-valid module versions that were never meant to run together.
- **Operator/author separation.** The shell is one fixed, auditable artifact; the app arrives as content signed by a third-party key the operator's policy admits. Verification is channel-independent: a bundle read from a USB stick verifies exactly like one fetched from a mirror or pushed over a relay.

**One authenticated statement, one authorization.** The bundle is the *only* way code arrives. The signed manifest commits to every module's `genesisHash` (§5.1), and the loader verifies each `.wasm`'s bytes against it, then admits each verified module under the kernel name it *derives* from the manifest's signed `(author, app, name)` triple (§5.1) — a policy decision (§12.5) followed by `SetHandler`. Admission touches no replay state, so an equal-version reload just re-binds cleanly — a reboot re-reading the same bundle installs the same modules again with no collision. A **live update** is not a separate mechanism: it is delivering a bundle whose manifest `version` is higher, which the freshness guard (below) requires; it lands on the same names because the same key signed it, and a bundle from any other key lands on names of its own.

**Manifest envelope.** `[suite: 1][author_pk: 32][sig: 64][manifest: UTF-8 JSON to end]` — an Ed25519 detached signature over `DOMAIN_manifest ‖ suite ‖ json`, where `DOMAIN_manifest` is `"seedkernel-manifest-sig-v1\0"` (§16.1), prepended before signing but not stored. The disjoint prefix means a manifest signature can never double as a guest `SIGN` or channel-handshake signature over the same bytes (§14). There is deliberately no canonical-JSON step: the envelope carries the exact signed bytes and the verifier parses exactly what it checked, so the bytes *are* the manifest and canonicalisation has nothing to bite on.

`suite` names the signature algorithm — `0x01` is Ed25519 (§16.1), and an unrecognised id is refused with its own error rather than reported as a bad signature, since "this bundle wants a newer host" and "someone tampered with this bundle" are different problems for an operator. Unlike the domain prefix the byte is **stored as well as signed**, and that pairing is the whole design: a verifier must read it *before* verifying, because another suite's key and signature are other widths, so it has to be legible up front — and because the signature it then checks commits to the same byte, an attacker who rewrites it only invalidates the manifest. A signature is therefore bound to the suite it was made under, and algorithm confusion between two suites is unrepresentable rather than merely unlikely (§14.1). This is the same discipline the channel suite byte follows (§12.6), on the axis that migrates independently.

**Manifest fields.**

| Field | Type | Enforced? | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `app` | string | **yes** | Names the coherent set. With `author_pk` it forms the **app key** `"<author hex>:<app>"` — this app's identity everywhere in the runtime: the freshness high-water key (see freshness below), the guest's signing namespace (`guestSignScope`, §12.2), the prefix of every module's kernel name (§5.1), and what a protocol binding points at (§12.10). Non-empty; free to contain `:`, since the fixed-length author prefix keeps the key unambiguous. |
| `version` | integer | **yes** | Monotonic version of the coherent set. A load whose `version` is below the persisted `(author, app)` high-water mark is refused as a downgrade (see freshness below). |
| `handles[]` | string[] | no | Protocol ids this app can serve. Absent ⇒ `[app]`, so an app that speaks only its own protocol declares nothing. **A declaration, not a claim:** it makes the app *eligible* for a binding and confers no traffic on its own (§12.10), so any number of bundles may declare the same id without contending for anything. |
| `modules[]` | `{name, hash}` | yes | One entry per WASM module. `name` does three jobs: the module's file in the container (`<name>.wasm`), the logical name the guest passes through MODULE_CALL (the bridge resolves it to the kernel name), and — after the app key — the kernel name it binds at, `"<author hex>:<app>:<name>"` (§5.1) — so it is unique within a manifest and restricted to `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`. `hash` is `genesisHash(wasm)` hex (§5.1) — the definitive declaration of which bytes the author authorized. `verifyBundle` checks every module against this hash, so by the time a module reaches `installBundle` its integrity is already proven. **There is no bind-name field:** the loader derives the name from values the author already signed, so a manifest holds nothing that could point a module at an unexpected handler. |
| `guest` | `{hash, caps, config?}` | if present | Optional — the zero-authority guest program and **everything about it**. A handler-only bundle (the chat demo — WASM handlers, no realm) omits the whole object, which is the same statement as "this bundle holds no authority": there is no empty `caps` list to write. |
| `guest.hash` | string | yes | `genesisHash(utf8(source))` hex of `guest.js`. |
| `guest.caps` | string[] | **yes** | The capability domains (§12.2) granted to the guest. The shell expands them to the allowed op set and wires only the matching backends; nothing outside them resolves. They are ordinary app powers the operator authorizes by choosing to run this bundle (none grants raw node-identity signing — the `crypto` domain's `SIGN` is scoped to this app's namespace, §12.2, §14). |
| `guest.config` | map (string → string \| number) | no | App-structural constants injected into the guest as `const APP = {…}`. Opaque to the runtime. Facts the runtime already derives do **not** belong here — see `BUNDLE` below. |

**Why `caps` and `config` live inside `guest`.** Both are the guest's alone: `caps` is the guest's entire authority (§12.2) and `config` only ever becomes its injected `APP`. WASM handlers carry no authority and read no config, so at the top level `caps` would be a mandatory field that a handler-only bundle must fill in with a meaningless `[]`. Nested, "no guest ⇒ zero authority" is the schema's shape rather than a rule prose has to state and every target has to honour.

**Load algorithm** (`loadBundle`). The shell is host code, so failures here **throw to the operator** — the §3 "drop" semantics apply to wire messages, not to loading a local file.

The load is three halves: `verifyBundle` (authenticity + integrity), `admit` (governance — §12.5), and `installBundle` (freshness + bind). A single predicate answers the single question: "may this verified bundle land on this host?"

*verify* — pure, nothing lands:

1. Unpack the blob, read `manifest.bundle`, and verify the envelope signature. Invalid ⇒ reject.
2. Read each module's `<name>.wasm` and, if a `guest` is declared, `guest.js`. A missing file ⇒ reject.

*admit* — governance, the one predicate:

3. Call the admission predicate with the `VerifiedBundle`. Return `true` to admit, `false` or throw to reject. The predicate IS the policy (§12.5) — a file-backed author allowlist, an interactive consent dialog, or "the bundle my operator handed me" are three constructors of it. Deny-all stays the default: the absent predicate admits nothing.

*install* — mechanics, then effect:

4. **Freshness.** Read the persisted high-water mark for `(author_pk, app)` (absent ⇒ −∞). Refuse if `version < high_water` — a downgrade, nothing lands. Otherwise the mark advances at the *end* of a fully successful load (see freshness below). Equal versions reload (an ordinary reboot); the mark is monotonic and never rewound, so once version N loads, nothing older ever loads again on this node.
5. Integrity-check **everything** before binding anything: each module against its `hash`, and the guest against `guest.hash` (§5.1). A mismatch anywhere ⇒ reject with nothing bound, so a bad file can never leave a partial bundle on the kernel.
6. **Install** atomically: instantiate every module first (pure, no table effect — compile, validate §4 exports, confirm each IS a handler). If any module fails to instantiate the accumulated refs are discarded and the whole load throws — nothing lands. Only when all instantiate successfully are they bound at `"<author hex>:<app>:<name>"` (§5.1).
7. Only now, and only if a guest was declared, may it run (§12.8): a realm (§12.3) over a cap-bridge restricted to `guest.caps`' op set, loaded with `op preamble ‖ const BUNDLE ‖ const APP = merge(guest.config, operator config) ‖ guest source`.

**Splitting verify from install is what makes consent possible.** An interactive shell must show a bundle's author and metadata and wait for the user *before* anything binds — the browser shell's `OFFER` flow (§11) is exactly that. With a single `admit` predicate between `verifyBundle` and `installBundle`, the shell calls `verifyBundle`, stops, and the predicate asks the user before `installBundle` ever sees the bundle. That is one predicate, one answer.

**The runtime's facts reach the guest as `BUNDLE`, never as hand-written config.** Alongside `APP`, the shell injects `const BUNDLE = { app, author, signPrefix }` — everything it derived from the admitted manifest: the app name, the author's key, and the guest signing prefix `DOMAIN_guest ‖ guestSignScope(author, app)` (§12.2). An author who instead baked these into `config` would be restating a load-time fact at build time, and a copy that silently disagrees fails as signatures that verify nowhere with nothing naming the cause — the same one-file rule the `DOMAIN_*` family follows (§16.1).

**Module names stay in the bridge.** The logical→kernel name map lives in the cap-bridge, not in `BUNDLE`. A guest calls its own modules by the logical name from its manifest through MODULE_CALL (`"codec"`, `"reputation"`), and the bridge resolves to the kernel name — so kernel names never leave the host at all, and a guest with the module cap can only reach modules it declared.

`BUNDLE` is deliberately a *separate* const from `APP`. Operator config merges over `APP` (below), so anything living there is operator-writable — including, if `signPrefix` were there, the guest's own signing namespace. Nothing in `BUNDLE` can be overridden at boot.

**Admission is a step inside the loader, not a separate component.** Binding a module *is* the loader's job, and it is the whole job: the loader keeps no side table. For each verified module it calls `SetHandler(name, instance)` directly — the manifest's `modules[].hash` is the definitive declaration of which bytes the author authorized, and `verifyBundle` already proved the bytes match. There is no per-module callback: trusting an author means trusting everything they sign.

**The policy needs no state because the name already carries it.** An admission decision would once have had to ask "who owns this name?", which meant a register mapping names to owners and a rule for updating it. With the author derived into the name (§5.1) that question has no content: a name is reachable only to the key that derives it, so the only bundle that can ever re-bind a name is one signed by the author whose name it is. The policy is a pure function of the bundle in front of it, the kernel table is the only install state on the host, and neither can drift from the other.

**One authentication, one authorization.** The manifest signature authenticates and integrity-checks the *set* (verifyBundle); the content-hash check binds each module's bytes to the manifest's commitment; the admission predicate (§12.5) authorizes the *bundle* — one predicate, one answer, between verify and install. Every module the manifest declares is authorized by construction — the author signed its hash, and the hash matched the bytes. The manifest is the single authenticated statement, the predicate the single authorization decision.

**Operator config wins.** The shell merges the operator's `--app-config` *over* the manifest's `config` before injection. The split is intentional: author-signed `config` carries content-structural constants (a storage app's k/m/blockSize), the operator's carries per-node policy (a quota). The merge is opaque — the shell never inspects a key — so the operator can even override a structural constant. That fits the trust model (the operator's host *is* the TCB, §14), but bundle authors should not assume their `config` reaches the guest unmodified.

**Bundle freshness.** `version` is an enforced monotonic integer, not a label: step 4 refuses any bundle whose `version` is below the persisted `(author, app)` high-water mark, so an older signed bundle — a stale relay copy, or a confused provisioning step handing over yesterday's build — is rejected as a downgrade. The whole bundle loads wholesale every boot, and neither guest nor modules carries a per-item version, so `version` is the single downgrade guard for the set. The mark is host-local persisted state; a deliberate rollback is an out-of-band operator action (the operator is the TCB, §14). See §14.

### 12.5 The admission policy

Admission (§12.4) asks exactly one question — *may this author's signed bundle land on this host?* — and one policy answers it. The form is a single predicate `admit(v: VerifiedBundle) → bool | Promise<bool>`, called between `verifyBundle` and `installBundle`. Three constructors of it cover three deployment postures:

- **authorAllowlist(authors)** — a closed set of hex Ed25519 pubkeys parsed from `--policy <allowed-keys.json>`. Trusting an author means trusting every module and guest their manifest declares — the manifest's `modules[].hash` commits to exactly which bytes are authorized, and `verifyBundle` already proved the bytes match.
- An **interactive consent dialog** — the browser shell's posture: `verifyBundle` reveals the author and manifest to the user, and the predicate returns `true` only once the user says yes.
- **admitAll** — "the bundle my operator handed me IS the trust decision." A StorageNode loads exactly the one bundle it was configured with; the choice of bundle already settled admission.

All three are the SAME type — one seam, not three mechanisms layered on top of each other.

The policy file (when present) is `--policy <allowed-keys.json>` (`host/policy.ts`), parsed strictly — a malformed file fails the boot loudly rather than silently widening trust:

```json
{
  "authors": ["<author ed25519 pubkey, hex>", "…"]
}
```

| Field | Required | Semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `authors` | yes, non-empty | The closed set of keys that may sign a bundle manifest (§12.4 step 2). Trusting an author means trusting every module and guest their manifest declares — the manifest's `modules[].hash` commits to exactly which bytes are authorized, and `verifyBundle` already proved the bytes match before the predicate runs. |

There is no per-module allowlist: the manifest IS the definitive list of authorized modules. An author who signs a manifest with five modules is authorizing all five. If an operator wants only some of an author's modules, the author publishes a separate bundle.

**Omitting `--policy` is deny-all, not "no policy".** A node with no configured predicate runs `denyAll`: it boots, serves, and refuses every manifest. Trust is something an operator adds deliberately; the absence of a decision is never permission. One shared constant (`denyAll`) resolves this, so every target — the Node shell and the native loader (§12.9) — boots the same posture, with no permissive default of its own.

**Revocation is host-side.** A handler is a pure transform with no imports (§4.2), so nothing in the sandbox can reach the loader — there is no revoke-message. Undoing a bind is an operator action: `remove(name)` `SetHandler`s the slot empty, and the policy's closed author set prevents the same key from re-binding behind it. A deployment wanting *remote-triggered* revocation builds a trusted host-side path to `remove` (an operator console over an authenticated channel, a signed control bundle): the decision and the mutation both stay in host code, where the TCB is (§14).

**The emergency path is the ordinary path.** There is no "replace this handler directly" seam, and its absence is deliberate. If a bug is found in a handler, the fix is a signed bundle at a higher `version` from the same author, admitted under the policy above — the same act on a running node as on a booting one, exercised on every release rather than held in reserve for the day it is needed. A dedicated emergency seam would be a second way to occupy a slot, reachable only in a crisis and therefore least tested exactly when it matters most; and it would be the one entry in the table with no signature behind it, sitting at a name it could not have derived, so nothing could afterward say who authored what runs there. An operator's emergency powers are the powers they use daily: sign a bundle, load it. The narrow case this forecloses — a handler so broken the node cannot reach the point of loading a bundle — is a boot-path failure, answered by the operator's control of what the node boots with (a different bundle on disk, a rollback), not by an in-process seam whose own code path would have to survive whatever broke the first.

The *guest's* §12.2 cap domains are **not** gated by this file — they come from the signed manifest, bounded by which bundle the operator chose to run (`--bundle`). No per-author gate is needed because the one dangerous power — raw node-identity signing — isn't grantable at all: a guest's `SIGN` is confined to its app scope (§12.2, §14), and the rest (`fs`, `net`, hashing, …) are ordinary app powers.

### 12.6 Node↔node transport: channel identity binding

A real socket carries no trustworthy "from" field, so before a connection delivers frames it runs a mutual challenge/response (`host/net-link.ts`) proving each end holds the kernel private key for the pubkey it claims — the same binding `RtcNetwork` applies to each WebRTC data channel (§11, §12.7). `PeerLink` is transport-agnostic over any channel that delivers whole messages: raw TCP (length-prefix framing) node↔node, RFC 6455 WebSocket (`ws.wasm` framing) browser↔node (`host/net-node.ts`), or a WebRTC `RTCDataChannel` peer↔peer (`host/net-rtc.ts`, §12.7) — same handshake, same frame plane, only the bottom byte-pipe swaps. Every transport enforces one wire-visible frame cap, `MAX_FRAME_BYTES` (16 MiB, §16.1), checked against the length prefix (TCP) or frame length (WS) **before** the body is buffered, so an unauthenticated peer cannot make a node allocate more than a single frame. TCP and WebSocket cap identically.

Three link-layer messages, each tagged with a leading type byte:

```
HELLO = [0x01][suite: 1][pubkey: 32][nonce: 32][eph: 32]   sent by both ends immediately
AUTH  = [0x02][sig: 64]                                    sig = Ed25519(transcript) — see below
FRAME = [0x03][AEAD record ..]                             accepted only after AUTH verifies
```

`eph` is a fresh **ephemeral X25519 public key**, generated per connection. AUTH signs the whole **transcript**, not just a nonce:

```
transcript = DOMAIN_channel ‖ lo ‖ hi
             {lo, hi} = the two `suite ‖ pubkey ‖ nonce ‖ eph` halves (mine, the peer's) sorted by bytes
```

Both ends derive the *same* transcript — the two `suite ‖ pubkey ‖ nonce ‖ eph` halves ordered canonically, so dialer and accepter agree regardless of who opened the socket — each signs it and verifies the peer's AUTH against it.

**`suite` names the handshake, and is not negotiated.** `0x01` is the genesis suite (§16.1): Ed25519 identity, ephemeral X25519, ChaCha20-Poly1305 records. A link speaks exactly one suite — an unrecognised id closes the connection, and HELLO is a fixed width per suite, so trailing bytes are malformed rather than forward-compatible. There is no list, no fallback, and no "highest common" rule. What the byte buys is that **HELLO is self-describing**: a later suite may change every field width below it — an ML-KEM-768 encapsulation key is 1184 bytes against the 32 here — and the two formats are still unambiguous on the wire, so a migration is a rollout rather than a network-wide flag day (§14.1). Because the byte is the first thing in each transcript half, it is covered by both signatures: an in-path attacker who flips it only makes the two ends sign different bytes, so AUTH fails and the link dies. A suite is *chosen* by the endpoints, never *forced* by the network. The HELLO body a node sends and the half it signs are one construction in `net-link.ts`, so the wire format and the signed format cannot drift apart. Because the signature commits to **both identities, both nonces, and both ephemeral keys**, a signature collected on one connection — even from a node used as a signing oracle — names the wrong peer elsewhere and fails to verify, closing the impersonation hole a nonce-only AUTH would leave (sign the victim's nonce, replay it as the victim); see §14. `DOMAIN_channel` is `"seedkernel-channel-id-v1\0"` — domain separation so a handshake signature cannot double as another protocol's over the same bytes. An outbound dial pins `expectPeerId`: if the far end's HELLO presents a different key, the link closes. Frames sent before authentication are queued, bounded by `MAX_QUEUE_BYTES` (1 MiB) with oldest-dropped — a byte bound, not a frame count — so a peer that never authenticates cannot make a node hoard memory.

**The signed ephemeral key makes this an AKE.** Because the identity signature covers `eph`, the handshake is a SIGMA-style authenticated key exchange: the signature binds the key exchange, and — since it already covers *both* identities — there is no separate identity-MAC seam to get wrong. Once both AUTHs verify, each end computes the ephemeral–ephemeral DH `X25519(my_eph_sk, peer_eph_pk)` and derives two directional session keys from it and the transcript hash, `KDF(dh, transcript_hash, label)`, the canonical lo/hi ordering assigning directions (the `lo` end encrypts with `k_lo→hi`, decrypts with `k_hi→lo`; `hi` mirrors). Every post-AUTH FRAME is then a **ChaCha20-Poly1305-IETF record** under the sending key, with an implicit monotonic per-direction counter as the nonce and strict enforcement on receive. There is exactly one post-handshake frame type — the AEAD record — so no plane split, no downgrade seam. The identity Ed25519 key stays signing-only and never takes a DH role, disjoint from the sealed-box / Curve25519 uses of the node key (§12.9, §14).

Above the link, `Transport` (`host/net.ts`) runs typed request/response inside the encrypted record channel — a single frame plane, no separate unauthenticated bulk path:

```
req = [0x00][corr: u32][pidLen: u8][protocolId: utf8][type: u8][payload ..]
res = [0x01][corr: u32][payload ..]
```

The `res` frame carries no `type`: the requester matches by `corr` and already knows the `type` it asked for, so echoing it is dead weight. Block bytes ride this plane too (in seed store a STORE pushes bytes in a `req` body, a FETCH returns them in a `res` body), so the record layer authenticates and encrypts them like any frame; content-addressing (`genesisHash(bytes) == block_id`) stays the app-level admission check on those payloads, not the transport's integrity story. A response resolves only if it arrives from the peer the request went to, so a malicious cohort member cannot answer on another's behalf by guessing the counter. Scatter-gather is the guest's own: because `NET_SEND` hands it a real Promise (§12.2, §12.3), a fan-out is `Promise.all` over a distinct request per peer (broadcasting one payload is just N identical entries) — partial results by construction, since an unreachable peer resolves `[ok 0]` rather than rejecting the batch. The transport's one concurrency primitive is the single request/response.

**What the handshake gives.** Because AUTH signs the full transcript, it authenticates that the far end held the claimed private key *for this exchange*: bound to the exact identities, nonces, and ephemeral keys that produced it, the signature cannot be harvested on one connection and replayed on another, and a signing oracle yields nothing reusable. The same signature binds the ephemeral keys, so the session is authenticated end to end. Every post-AUTH frame is then individually authenticated, confidential, and replay-protected (strict counter enforcement over the ordered channel), and the session is **forward-secret** because the DH keys are ephemeral — an in-path attacker who hijacks the live stream after authentication can neither read nor forge frames. `PeerLink` therefore needs no external tunnel (TLS, Noise); the record layer lives in the shared `net-link.ts`, uniform across TCP, WebSocket, and WebRTC. See §14.

### 12.7 Browser↔console WebRTC

§12.6's `PeerLink` rides any whole-message channel, and a WebRTC `RTCDataChannel` is one — which turns WebRTC into a first-class `Network` exposing the same `send` / `peers` surface as the TCP and WebSocket transports.

**`RtcNetwork` (`host/net-rtc.ts`) — relay-signaled mesh.** Peers reach each other directly over `RTCDataChannel`s; the relay (`scripts/relay.mjs`) is only the *signaling* rendezvous for SDP/ICE and can be killed once channels are open — no server in the data path. One ordered binary channel per peer carries everything, and `Transport` (§12.6) rides on top untouched, so a storage cohort gets P2P for free while a fire-and-forget app (chat) consumes `send` directly. The `Signaling` seam is pluggable — relay, DHT, gossip, or even an existing `PeerLink` between two connected peers — and carries *no* SDP-fingerprint signature, because identity is proven in-channel: `PeerLink`'s HELLO/AUTH runs *inside* the data channel (§12.6), stronger than a one-shot SDP-fingerprint assertion at the signaling layer (§11). A MITM relay can splice SDP and bring DTLS up to itself but can never complete AUTH without the peer's private key, so the link never authenticates and never delivers a byte. The module is browser-native (it uses the platform `RTCPeerConnection`); a Node/Bun *console* node joins by passing a `peerConnectionFactory` (`weriftPeerConnectionFactory`, `host/net-rtc-node.ts`) — "swap the connection, keep the stack," the §12.6 move applied to WebRTC. werift (pure-TS) is used over native `node-datachannel`, which segfaults under Bun.

**Confidentiality.** Like every transport, the WebRTC fabric's frames are confidential and integrity-protected by the §12.6 AKE record layer. A data channel is also DTLS-encrypted, a redundant-but-harmless second layer underneath. As on the raw transports, the in-channel AUTH supplies the identity binding DTLS alone does not (§11).

### 12.8 The shell

`boot(opts)` (`host/main.ts`, `./shell`) assembles all of the above — the kernel, the bundle loader under its admission policy, the fs/net capability backends, the node identity — and returns a `Shell` (`loadBundle`, `runGuest`, `serve`); a CLI wraps it:

```sh
node build/host/main-node.js --policy ./allowed-keys.json --dir ./data --key ./node.key \
     --listen 0.0.0.0:7000 [--ws-listen 0.0.0.0:7001] \
     --bundle ./app-bundle [--peers <pk>@host:port,…] [--put file] [--get hex[:hex…] --out file]
```

A serving node that has loaded a bundle runs the app's *initiator* side on demand (`runGuest` → `realm.call`, which may `await` net) **and** serves its *request* side from the **same** confined realm (`serve` routes `transport.onRequest` to the guest's `handle` entrypoint via `realm.callSync` — the holder answers from local fs + crypto synchronously, so it responds while an initiator is parked mid-`await` in that realm). The shell is application-neutral — it can host any signed app — and for a self-contained non-browser deployment the Go/native target ships it as a single binary (§12.9). seed store's WASM README has a complete storage walkthrough.

### 12.9 The Go/native shell — the primary non-browser deployment

The §12.8 shell runs as JS on Node or Bun, but the **recommended** way to run a node outside the browser is the **Go/native target** (`native/`, a top-level Go module): a single self-contained, cgo-free binary — `seedloader` — with no Node, no Bun, and no separate JS engine to install on the box.

It is a **platform target, not a reimplementation.** All protocol and app logic stays shared TypeScript — the cap-bridge (§12.2), the node↔node transport (§12.6: the PeerLink AKE, the encrypted request/response Transport, the routing), the loader and its admission policy (§12.4–§12.5), bundle verification (§12.4), the confined safe-js guest (§12.3) — the same code the other targets run, just hosted differently. Go supplies only the platform **primitives** the §1 table calls for; protocol is never re-derived in a second language (*Go grows with primitives, never with logic*).

This is enforced mechanically: the shared modules are compiled by `tsc` and concatenated into `native/*.gen.js` by `scripts/bundle-loader.mjs` (`npm run build:loader-bundles`), which the loader `//go:embed`s and evaluates in QuickJS. Nothing under `native/` is a hand-written second copy. Each bundle runs over a *seam* — a small TypeScript adapter (`host/native-shim.ts`) satisfying the same interfaces the JS host does (`BundleHost`, `FreshnessStore`) by forwarding to Go's byte-level `bridge`. Because the adapter is typechecked against those interfaces, a shared-rule change the native target fails to honor is a **compile error**, not a silent divergence. The seam carries no rules of its own: who may install (§12.5), the name derivation (§5.1), the admit-then-`SetHandler` step (§12.4), the manifest signature and its domain prefix (§12.4), the freshness arithmetic, and the deny-all default (§14) all live in the shared modules — one implementation of each to audit.

The §3 handler table is Go's own `map[string]*entry` — the kernel is a contract, so the native target implements it rather than embedding it. Concretely the binary embeds and drives, over [wazero](https://wazero.io) (a pure-Go, cgo-free wasm runtime):

- **`libsodium.wasm`** — the *same* crypto blob as the browser/Node build, which is exactly what makes a Go node's sealed boxes, XChaCha20 blocks, and Ed25519→Curve25519 conversions byte-identical to a JS node's. Wire/crypto parity is free when it is literally the same code.
- **a prebuilt QuickJS** (quickjs-ng, `native/qjs`) — so the shared host JS runs unmodified with no native JS-engine dependency. QuickJS is synchronous, so Go owns the event loop (timers, the JS job queue, socket delivery). A net `host.call` returns a real Promise to the guest: Go kicks off the host realm's Transport request under a call id and, when it settles, resolves the guest's pending Promise (`deliverNet`), and the shared loop pumps the guest realm so the awaiting entrypoint resumes — the same real-promise seam the Node/Bun build uses, driven by Go's loop instead of quickjs-emscripten's job pump. The confined guest runs in a second, zero-authority QuickJS realm whose only seam is `host.call`.
- **`ws.wasm`** — the *same* RFC 6455 framing blob the browser/Node targets use (`host/ws/ws-wasm-backend.ts`), driven over wazero and exposed to QuickJS as `__ws`. WebSocket framing is a no-capability byte transform (§12.1), not host code, so it is the identical module on every target; the handshake/codec state machine stays shared host JS (`ws-codec.ts` + `net-frame.ts`) running in QuickJS over a raw Go socket. Instantiated lazily on first WS use, so a pure node↔node TCP deployment never pays for it.

Go-native primitives back the capability seams: `os` for the §12.1 fs backend, `net` for the raw TCP socket — node↔node directly, and browser↔node under a WebSocket whose RFC 6455 framing is the shared `ws.wasm` above — and `crypto/rand` for entropy. WebRTC (§12.7) stays browser-only. The CLI mirrors §12.8 exactly:

```sh
seedloader --policy ./allowed-keys.json --dir ./data --key ./node.key \
     --listen 0.0.0.0:7000 [--ws-listen 0.0.0.0:7001] \
     --bundle ./app-bundle [--peers <pk>@host:port,…] [--put file] [--get hex[:hex…] --out file]
```

Because the wire and the bundles are shared, a Go node and a Node/Bun node interoperate directly in one cohort — `put` on either, `get` on the other, in both directions, against the same signed bundle and genesis (verified end-to-end for seed store by `WASM/scripts/loader-interop.sh`).

**Scope: the native target is a bundle-runner.** Its app path is the §12.4 bundle — load, verify, install the modules, run the guest — and its request path is transport → shared route bundle → cap-bridge → the installed handlers, each reached by name through `callHandler`. Both targets install code only from a signed bundle (§12.4), so the app-delivery surface is identical. There is no dispatch loop and no signature pipeline to keep in parity: the kernel is a name→id table (§3) and handlers are pure transforms (§4), so Go's only handler-facing duties are staging input into a handler's `scratch`, reading its output, and honoring a declared `scratchSize` (§4.1) — byte-identical to the JS host. The loader's admission and policy (§12.4–§12.5), bundle freshness (§12.4), and the domain prefixes (§16.1) are the same shared TS both targets run in QuickJS; the manifest and channel signatures the loader checks read their `DOMAIN_*` prefixes from that one evaluated `domains.ts`, so every signed preimage is byte-identical across the cohort by construction, not by a hand-copied constant.

**Size.** One file, ~7.5 MB stripped, cross-compiled to win/linux/mac with `GOOS`/`GOARCH` — nothing to install alongside it. The bulk is wazero's compiler backend (~4 MB) and the Go runtime (~2.4 MB); the protocol's own footprint stays tiny (§10.2). Against the JS shell — which needs a Node/Bun install plus the lazily-loaded ~1.5 MB QuickJS engines — the native binary trades a larger single artifact for zero external dependencies, the right shape for a server or an appliance.

**Performance.** Because the Go target drives the *same* `libsodium.wasm` under wazero that the JS targets run under V8, crypto throughput tracks node closely — Ed25519 verify and XChaCha20 land within ~10% either way, and the Reed–Solomon codec runs a touch *faster* (≈330 / 394 vs ≈315 / 319 MB/s encode / decode). The one deliberate exception is the block-id hash (BLAKE2b-256), which runs on **native Go** (`golang.org/x/crypto/blake2b`, byte-identical to libsodium and KAT-pinned): it sits on the storage data path and is the single primitive wazero ran the wasm materially slower than V8, so native (~600 vs ~390 MB/s) is the clear win. Per-frame overhead trails node by Go-side event-loop cost, not crypto. Reproduce with `go test -run x -bench . -benchmem ./...` from `native/`; the node baselines come from `WASM/tests/run.mjs` and seed store's `WASM/tests/bench.mjs`.

### 12.10 Protocol bindings — which app handles a message

Admission (§12.5) decides whether code may run. It does not decide who gets traffic, and after §5.1 it cannot: a node may hold two apps that both serve chat, authored by different keys, bound at names that never collide. Something has to say which one a message goes to.

**A frame names a protocol, not an app.** What travels is a protocol id in the Transport req frame (§12.6) — a chat message carries one, a storage message carries its op. It never names an app, an author, or a kernel name: those are node-local (§5.1), and a wire that named them would make every peer's install choices everyone else's business.

**A manifest declares what an app can serve; the user decides what it does serve.** `handles[]` (§12.4) lists the protocol ids a bundle is willing to answer for, defaulting to `[app]`. It is inert on its own. Delivery follows a host-local table the *user* owns:

```
bindings: protocol id → app key
```

pointing at the `"<author hex>:<app>"` of §12.4. To deliver, the host reads the frame's protocol id, looks up the app key, and calls that app's handler by its derived name (§5.1). An unbound protocol drops.

**Declaring is free, so it is not worth attacking.** Any number of bundles may declare `handles: ["chat"]`; none receives a byte until the user points a binding at it. This is why no register is needed to keep names apart *and* no race replaces it: the two acts an ownership register used to conflate — landing code, and receiving traffic — are now separate, one authorized by policy and one chosen by the user.

**Binding rules.** Three, and they are the whole of it:

- **Auto-bind only into a vacancy.** On install, each declared protocol with no binding binds to the new app. The first chat app a user installs simply works; there is no decision to surface because there is no alternative.
- **A contested protocol is a choice, never an error.** Install an app declaring a protocol already bound and it lands installed-but-unbound, with the choice offered to the user. Nothing is refused and nothing is displaced — this is how a node comes to hold two chat implementations, and how the user moves between them.
- **An update inherits only what it already had.** A same-author, higher-`version` bundle (§12.4) keeps its existing bindings; any *newly* declared protocol lands unbound. Otherwise a v2 could add a `handles` entry and inherit traffic on the strength of v1's approval.

**Rebinding is the answer to a dead or superseded author.** Point `chat` at a different app and it takes over; the previous app stays installed and intact, just idle. No uninstall, no name to vacate, and the move is one table write in either direction — because the two apps were never competing for a slot, only for a binding. That is the practical payoff of putting the author in the name: succeeding an abandoned app stops requiring cooperation from its author.

**One app per protocol.** The table maps to a single app key, not a list. A second handler on a protocol would be a *fan-out*, and today it would be a no-op: WASM handlers are pure transforms with zero authority (§4.2), so a would-be logger or archiver bound alongside a chat app can only return bytes the shell discards. The component that can genuinely act on a message is a guest, with declared `caps` (§12.2) — and binding one as an observer gives it every message on that protocol, which is an authority grant, not a preference. It needs its own approval showing what the app holds, and it must not share an affordance with "which chat app do I want." When that case arrives the extension is additive — the value becomes `{ view, observers[] }`, `view` staying the free preference and `observers` the granted feed — and the manifest already carries the `caps` such a prompt would have to show. Until then a single value is the honest shape.

**Bindings are shell state, not loader state, and hold no security property.** They survive restart alongside the rest of a shell's preferences (`sessionStorage` in the browser, the node's config elsewhere), and a user may rewrite one at any time. Nothing about integrity, authenticity, or authority rests on them: a binding cannot make unadmitted code run, cannot widen a guest's `caps`, and cannot let one app act in another's signing scope (§12.2). The worst a wrong binding does is send messages to the wrong app the user already chose to install — recoverable by rebinding. That is exactly why it belongs to the user and not to the policy file.
